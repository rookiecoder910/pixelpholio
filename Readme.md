<img src="assets/banner.png" alt="Pixelpholio Banner" width="100%"/>

Pixelpholio is a **2D platformer built entirely using Jetpack Compose + Canvas**, where each collectible unlocks a *real* developer skill. It's not just a game — it's an interactive portfolio that lets you play through my experience as an Android developer.
